# Transformer Parser

A special LL(1) that is specially designed for parsing token ids generated by an LLM transformer. The purpose of this parser is to be used
in a constrained decoder. In a constrained decoder it is normal to test the top k tokens with the highest probabilities
to see if they are considered valid and then the token with the highest probability that is valid is chosen to be added to the generated output.
This parser allows us to test tokens without actually adding them to the parse tree. After testing some tokens the most valued token can be
added to the parse tree once it has been chosen as an official token for the transformer's generated output.

Another feature that is useful for a constrained decoder is the ability to override the parser's validity logic by just never applying the tested token, even if it
is considered valid. The test results will provide the id of the rule that the token was tested against. This rule id can provide context that can be used to determine
validity of the token outside of what the parser is capable of understanding. One example is table column names. If the parser thinks that a token is a valid column
name when it really isn't, then the validity decision can be overidden.
