/*
 * There are 3 types of rules below:
 * standard - Must start with a string literal (used as the rule id and should be unique/unambiguous with other rules).
 * This rule is generally for defining what comes after a keyword.
 * special - Must start with a string literal like the standard rule, but this literal will be a special
 * token in the transformer vocabulary, meaning that it will be decoded as an empty string and only used for
 * informational purposes during generation.
 * fragment - Represents a part of a rule that cannot exist on its own.
 * [token] - Specifies that the IDENTIFIER should be used as a literal token that
 * expects the associated rule structure.
 * [literal] - Specifies a matcher for a token. Matchers are constrained by what they can
 * include. They basically represent a single token literal. You may provide a single list of 
 * possible tokens with the entire matcher being flagged as optional and/or repeatable.
 * [special_token] - Specifies the IDENTIFIER should be used as a special token that
 * expects the associated rule structure. Special tokens will not appear in the decoded output
 * of the transformer, so will only be for informational purposes.
 * [regex] - Used to loosely define which tokens are valid. The regular expression provided
 * should be used like a literal, except the expression determines what kind of tokens are valid.
 *
 * Another important note is that the first literal after each standar/special rule will have special
 * characters added around it so as to make them absolutely unique and not conflict with anything
 * that would be matched by a regular expression. These special literals will be used to identify the
 * start of the rules and must only be used for identifying the start of the rules.

// TODO How do we detect whether extra space tokens are even necessary for the expected text?


// A single regular expression r'' will only match a single token! Don't automatically assume that it'll match the same way that it would for normal text.
// We're ultimately making a grammar that is going to be used for matching token ids. Split the regular expression up into multiple literals if needed.

// TODO What do we do if a normal (not special) rule already has its literal in the vocabulary? I think the parser won't support using that token for any other part of the grammar if that is the case, but I forget.
// To be safe I have the translator enforcing that only new token are added for the start of each rule (except for fragments.)
